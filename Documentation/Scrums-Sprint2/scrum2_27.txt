2018-02-28T03:50:48Z wesley.scott: Today we met in person to get everyone's environments setup in AWS. 
We also solidfied our roles and tasks for Sprint 2. I created the Sprint Backlog File, uploaded it to GitHub, 
and assigned it to the developers for this sprint. This week, Ryan and I will be working on the database schema, 
I will keep Sprint 2 organized and on-track. Finally, I will be doing some research and tutorials for CodeStar so 
I'm not fumbling around the project with no idea what's going on.
