2018-03-07T00:38:18Z wesley.scott: Hey guys, hope everyone did well on the exam today. I haven't gotten much done the past few days, 
what with exams and everything. That being said, I plan on consuming copious amounts of caffeine tomorrow and getting some good work done. 
I'll finish up my end of the documentation, and probably jump in to AWS, as I've been itching to code recently. *No Roadblocks*

2018-03-07T00:39:47Z ryanahutchinson: I have finished the UCM and GRL diagrams will get started on the rest of the diagrams shortly. 
I would like to get going on the UI and coding but we need AWS Cognito up and running in some way. *Roadblock with needing AWS Cognito*

2018-03-07T00:50:00Z darrel.donald: Ryan finished the diagrams before I had a chance to even start on them. 
Then I tried to start looking into cognito but I can't figure out how to get in so i can try doing things with it. 
*Roadblock: Chris didn't deliver the shades, trenchcoat, and hat needed to gain access to cognito*

2018-03-07T00:59:59Z wesley.scott: I’ll jump in on cognito as well

2018-03-07T01:00:04Z ryanahutchinson: ok

2018-03-07T03:02:16Z yanan.hao: Sorry, I just woke up. I did some research of the AWS Cognito. I found this link about it: 
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html> , but not sure how to start. Need some help, 
hope to solve it when we meet soon. *No Roadblock*

2018-03-07T03:06:40Z jairus.mcelroy: Did some research on cognito but haven’t had enough time to really put time into it with so many 
tests this week. I have made a few changes to product backlog *no roadblocks*

2018-03-07T03:09:09Z ryanahutchinson: What changes

2018-03-07T03:10:24Z jairus.mcelroy: I Haven’t uploaded it so I will when I get home.

2018-03-07T03:51:32Z chris.baierski: Had two tests today, haven't had a chance to work on UI but I will on thursday/friday/ 
*NO ROADBLOCKS*
